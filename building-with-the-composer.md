# Building with the composer

To build Varbase using the [**Varbase Build**](https://github.com/Vardot/varbase-build) with Composer, first you need to [install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the \[global Composer installation\]\([https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md\#globally](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally)\).  
> You might need to replace \`composer\` with \`php composer.phar\` \(or similar\)  
> for your setup.

After making sure that you have installed Composer successfully on your development machine, you can create the project with this command:

`composer create-project Vardot/varbase-build:8.4.0-beta16 PROJECT_DIR_NAME--stability beta --no-interaction`
