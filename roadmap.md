## Feature Roadmap

These epics still need to be further research and refined. Please [contact us](http://varbase.vardot.com/contact) if you have ideas about realization or contribution.

We have broken down the epics by month to provide a clear and transparent roadmap.
Apart from the regular Drupal updates, bug fixes, these are new features to be added.

| Month | Epic |

| July 2017 | - Landing pages using Paragraphs <br /> - Varbase Search feature to provide turnkey search feature <br /> - Cleanup composer installer to provide project-specific composer file for easier updates <br /> - Add ability to embed tweets, and other rich content in WYSIWYG |
| August 2017 | - Add "Trash" feature for deleted content <br /> - Add "coming soon" feature for new sites <br /> |
| September 2017 | _To be determined_  |
